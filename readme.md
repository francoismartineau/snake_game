#This is a snake game projected to the console. 


 The snake follows a fixed path that maximizes its length, at the cost of being slow.

Now it takes the shortest path using Dijkstra. The sides that are not blocked by walls teleport the snake Pac-man style.

A map is a text file containing spaces and '#' like shown in the game. This map has more walls.

A user started playing in invicible mode and stopped when this loop emerged from the auto surviving.
