This is a snake game projected to the console. 


 The snake follows a fixed path that maximizes its length, at the cost of being slow.

Now it takes the shortest path using Dijkstra. The sides not blocked by walls teleports the snake Pac-man style.

A map is a text file containing spaces and '#' like shown in the game. This map is different.
